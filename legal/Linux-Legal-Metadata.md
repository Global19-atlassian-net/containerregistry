# Instructions for Finding Linux Legal Metadata

*(Licenses, Copyright and Source Code)*

Linux based container images typically contain multiple software components, each built from different source and with different licensing. It is important that users of these images can determine the license information for these images and have a link back to the source for copyright and pedigree information.

This document is intended to be informative, primarily defining patterns for discovering license and pedigree information for certain Linux based containers and describing expectations (whether the desired information can be found within the images). We currently only provide information for Ubuntu, Debian and Alpine Linux distributions and their official packages installed with an official package manager for that Linux distribution. We plan to update this document with information for other major Linux builds like CentOS. This information can change at any time, which also demonstrates why using the documented patterns is important.

This document focuses solely on official Linux distros and packages pulled in by their official package managers. Windows based containers are out of scope. For licensing information about any other component (whether open source or closed source) in a Microsoft container, other than the specific base images and official packages covered in this document, please see the "Licensing" section in the container's Docker Hub landing page.

This document answers two basic questions:

*   How can I interrogate a Linux image to determine licensing and version information for the Linux base image and packages pulled in by the Linux distribution's official package manager?
*   Where can I look to learn about source pedigree information for a Linux image and its official packages from external sources (since it is difficult/impossible to learn everything from an image)?

This document uses .NET Core as an example throughout, to demonstrate how to find license information for a variety of Linux distros. These distros are not uniform, which is why looking at multiple examples is useful. You can find the artifacts that will be used as examples at:â€¯[.NET Core Docker files](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker) and [.NET Core container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet/).

This document describes the licensing and source pedigree of the following components:

*   [Base images](https://github.com/microsoft/oss-law-central/blob/master/image-artifact-details.md#Base-Images) (from Docker Hub)
*   [Additional official packages](https://github.com/microsoft/oss-law-central/blob/master/image-artifact-details.md#Additional-Packages) (from Linux package managers)

## Base Images

Images are provided for a set of Linux distros, delivered via [MCR](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-syndicates-container-catalog/) (and advertised on Docker Hub). The Linux distros are acquired from Docker Hub as part of building the images. The following base images are delivered as components of the .NET Core images:

*   [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine)
*   [debian](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian)
*   [ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu)
*   [buildpack-deps](https://hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps)

.NET Core is dependent on those images, and the individuals/organizations that build them, to satisfactorily describe the licensing and pedigree of these images.

### Retrieving Package Information From Base Images

The practices to retrieve package information vary across the dependent distro types. This is demonstrated via the following introspection technique, for each of the supported distros.

Note: The output of the commands is intentionally cut-off for purposes of brevity. The output you see below is intended to demonstrate the pattern, and you can repeat it to view all current license information for the base image of your choosing.

#### alpine

You can retrieve the full list of packages installed within Alpine images, as demonstrated below.

```
$ docker run --rm alpine:3.11 apk list -I
musl-1.1.24-r0 x86_64 {musl} (MIT) [installed]
zlib-1.2.11-r3 x86_64 {zlib} (Zlib) [installed]
apk-tools-2.10.4-r3 x86_64 {apk-tools} (GPL2) [installed]
musl-utils-1.1.24-r0 x86_64 {musl} (MIT BSD GPL2+) [installed]
libssl1.1-1.1.1d-r2 x86_64 {openssl} (OpenSSL) [installed]
alpine-baselayout-3.2.0-r3 x86_64 {alpine-baselayout} (GPL-2.0-only) [installed]
alpine-keys-2.1-r2 x86_64 {alpine-keys} (MIT) [installed]
busybox-1.31.1-r8 x86_64 {busybox} (GPL-2.0-only) [installed]
scanelf-1.2.4-r0 x86_64 {pax-utils} (GPL-2.0-only) [installed]
libc-utils-0.7.2-r0 x86_64 {libc-dev} (BSD) [installed]
libtls-standalone-2.9.1-r0 x86_64 {libtls-standalone} (ISC) [installed]
ssl_client-1.31.1-r8 x86_64 {busybox} (GPL-2.0-only) [installed]
ca-certificates-cacert-20191127-r0 x86_64 {ca-certificates} (MPL-2.0 GPL-2.0-or-later) [installed]
libcrypto1.1-1.1.1d-r2 x86_64 {openssl} (OpenSSL) [installed]
```

The package listing above includes the license in the fourth cell. You can also retrieve the license for any single package, as demonstrated below. This example retrieves the musl license from the alpine:3.11 image.

```
$ docker run --rm alpine:3.11 apk info --license musl
musl-1.1.24-r0 license:
MIT
You can retrieve the source for any package by looking up the package on the [alpine package website](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages). You must enter the package name, branch (which corresponds to the Alpine version), and architecture. Finding the [information for the zlib package](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=zlib&branch=v3.11&repo=main&arch=x86) is demonstrated below.
```

Navigating the [Package link](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/v3.11/main/x86/zlib) will show detailed package information including the originating source amongst other information.

#### debian

You can retrieve the full list of packages installed within Debian images, as demonstrated below.

```
$ docker run --rm debian:buster-slim dpkg-query -l
Desired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold
| Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend

...
```

You can retrieve the license for any package, as demonstrated below. This example retrieves the apt license from the debian:buster-slim image by performing the following steps with a single command:

1.  List out the package contents
2.  Find the copyright file
3.  Print out the copyright file contents

```
$ docker run --rm debian:buster-slim sh -c 'cat `dpkg -L apt | grep copyright`'

```

#### buildpack-deps

The Debian and Ubuntu variants of [buildpack-deps](https://hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps) are used as base images, enabling you to use the same patterns described above to retrieve the licensing information for these images.

### Retrieving Pedigree Information for Base Images**

The base images are retrieved from official Docker image repositories which provide detailed information about the images. This information includes layer information, source code, license information, etc. This information is stored in the [Official Images "Extended Information" repository](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info) and is split into two types:

*   remote
    *   gathered from the Docker Hub/Registry API
    *   image digests/blobs, transfer sizes, image metadata, etc.
*   local
    *   inspected from the image on-disk after it is pulled
    *   installed packages, creation date, architecture, environment variables, detected licenses, etc.

An abbreviated copy of the "extended information" for the debian:buster-slim image is included below, first the [remote](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/debian/remote/buster-slim.md) and then the [local](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/debian/local/buster-slim.md) information.

### Additional Packages

Images often install a set of packages (from the associated package manager for the distro) in addition the the package provided by the base image. You can inspect the Dockerfiles to discover these additional packages.

You can see an example of the additional packages the .NET Core images install in this [runtime-deps](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-runtime-deps) Dockerfile, which is copied below (see RUN apt-get instruction).

```
FROM debian:buster-slim
RUN apt-get update \
&& apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
ca-certificates \
\

# .NET Core dependencies

libc6 \
libgcc1 \
libgssapi-krb5-2 \
libicu63 \
libssl1.1 \
libstdc++6 \
zlib1g \
&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Configure web servers to bind to port 80 when present

ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80 \

# Enable detection of running in a container

DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER=true
```

There is no guarantee that these additional packages are not present in the base image, but typically they will not be (hence why they are explicitly installed), as is demonstrated below.

```
$ docker run --rm debian:buster-slim apt list ca-certificates

Listing...

$ docker run --rm mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-deps:3.1-buster-slim apt list ca-certificates

Listing...

ca-certificates/now 20190110 all [installed,local]
```

These patterns can be repeated for packages that are added in [.NET Core images (above and beyond the base image)](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/documentation/image-artifact-details.md).
